## Robotics Academy - Improve Deep learning Exercise

JdeRobot is a toolkit for developing Robotics Applications. Robotics applications are typically distributed, made up of a collection of concurrent asynchronous components which communicate using some middleware (. Building robotics applications is a complex task. Integrating existing nodes or libraries that provide already solved functionality, and using several tools may increase the software robustness and shorten the development time. JdeRobot provides several tools, libraries and reusable nodes. The main aim of this project is to improve the Deep learning exercise of JdeRobot, by Improving the user interface, and by Enabling GPU support while executing the exercise from the docker container.

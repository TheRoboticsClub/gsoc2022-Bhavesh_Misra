Hello!

My name is Bhavesh Misra, a sophomore at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, India. I am a machine learning and Computer Vision enthusiast and found out about JdeRobot from a senior who showed it to us when I started looking for various GSoC organisations, back in November 2021. I did enjoy working with JdeRobot but then stopped for a while because it got too difficult fo me xD. N. Apart from searching for code on StackOverflow and crying about why Machine learning contains soo much Math, I like to play games, namely Pokemon and Clash Royale and Reading.

## Preliminaries

During the first week of the Community bonding period, My mentors and I had a meet, where the work for the Bonding period was decided. However, I was not able to perform most of that successfully, due to college ending and me travelling to my hometown, and I didn't have good Wi-Fi available. Hence, I decided to shift most of the work to Community bonding period - week 3.

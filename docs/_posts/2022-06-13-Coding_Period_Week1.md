## Overview
So basically, the first week of the coding period is understanding the different formats that are available to represent Machine learning models, and to understand them. Currently, Robotics Academy[1] uses the ONNX[2] format to do this work, however, my work is to understand the ONNX and the NNEF[3] formats.

Soo, in order to carry out the Objectives, I plan to use the ONNX Model Zoo[4] and the NNEF model Zoo[5] to compare the speeds of the models in general, and then, if time permits, try running them for the Robotics Academy- Deep Learning HUman Detection exercise. 
I have worked with TensorFlow before, but not with Pytorch. Hence, I plan to understand the Pytorch framework as well, to carry out the final objective.


## Objectives
- [] Compare the same models in ONNX and NNEF formats in terms of time and accuracy
- [] CHeck the compatibility of both formats for Robotics Academy
- [] Try converting a model in TensorFlow and Pytorch to both ONNX and NNEF formats

## Issues and Pull requests.

## The execution

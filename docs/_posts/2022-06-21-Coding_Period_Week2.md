## Overview

So basically, the first week of the coding period ididn't go as well as planned, and I realised that you need to give MUCHH MORE TIMEE to the work that you are doing, and hence, I decided to work on a remaining task of week 1 for week 2 as well. 
Now, as per the week 2 tasks, I feel that the TensorFlow Object detection one should be easier, as I have TRIED (read Tried, not Worked xD) it before, and it gave me a hugeee headache. But now, i'll be more focused and work on it more.
As per the reading stuff part, that should be easy, but time-consuming, as the only thing that I do is search my errors on StackOverflow.   
Let's see how week 2 goes!

## Objectives

- [] Read something about Models that are specifically used for human detection
- [] Understand and work on TFOD (TensorFlow Object Detection), and if time permits, learn PyTorch (like atleast be in a position to understand code in PyTorch)
- [] Convert a model from TensorFlow(Models from TFOD) to ONNX 
- [] Check the compatibility of both formats for Robotics Academy

## Issues and Pull requests.
